# 🧠 NeighborFit – Problem Solving & Technical Documentation

## 🔍 Problem Definition

Choosing the right neighborhood is a deeply personal decision based on lifestyle, safety, budget, and access to green spaces or amenities. However, current tools (like housing websites or maps) are either too generic or focused on real estate listings.

**Goal:** Build a full-stack application that helps users discover neighborhoods aligned with their lifestyle preferences (e.g., safety, affordable rent, green spaces).

## 📊 User Research & Hypotheses

### Personas
- **Student**: Needs affordable rent and peaceful surroundings.
- **Working Professional**: Prioritizes safety and commute convenience.
- **Family**: Prefers green areas and good schools.

### Hypotheses
- Users don’t just search by rent or location — they care about **how a place feels**.
- A lightweight matching system based on lifestyle priorities can guide better neighborhood discovery.

## 🔍 Existing Solutions & Gaps

| Platform | Focus | Gaps |
|---------|-------|------|
| 99acres / MagicBricks | Real estate | No lifestyle-based filters |
| WalkScore | Walkability | Limited to certain cities |
| Numbeo | Data-rich | Not personalized |

## 🧠 Matching Algorithm

We used a **scoring system** based on selected lifestyle preferences:

### Criteria Considered:
- ✅ Safety
- ✅ Affordable Rent
- ✅ Green Spaces

```js
score = (safety ? 1 : 0) + (rent ? 1 : 0) + (green ? 1 : 0)
🗂️ Data Structure & Challenges
Mock Dataset Used
json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "name": "Greenview", "safety": true, "rent": true, "green": true },
  { "name": "UrbanSide", "safety": false, "rent": false, "green": false }
]
Real-World Challenges
Lack of open, structured neighborhood data in India.

API access is expensive or gated.

Solution: created mock data mimicking real attributes.

🏗️ System Design
Frontend: React + Vite

Backend: (To be added)

Data Source: Static JSON (can scale to DB/API later)

🔁 Trade-offs & Design Rationale
Decision	Trade-off
Use mock data	Allows fast prototyping, but lacks real-time value
No backend (yet)	Simplifies deployment, but limits data scalability
Weighted scoring	Simple, explainable, but lacks depth

✅ Testing & Validation
Manual testing with different preference combinations.

Ensured score bar updates reflect criteria correctly.

Validated against user expectations.

🚧 Limitations
No live data integration

No user accounts or saved preferences

Basic algorithm; no AI/ML ranking

🔮 Future Improvements
Add backend (Node.js/Flask) with real APIs

Collect user feedback via survey or feedback form

Use Firebase or Supabase for scalable storage

Add filters like “noise levels”, “commute time”, etc.
